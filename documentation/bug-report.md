# Bug Report

## Bug Title
Random values returned  when the sum of one of the parameters is 42

## Reporter

## Date
July 15, 2024 - 8:45pm PT

## Environment
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Application: Calculator CLI (public.ecr.aws/l4q9w4c5/loanpro-calculator-cli:latest)
- Tools: Docker, Ruby, RSpec, Aruba

## Description
When the total sum of one of the numbers parameters is 42 and the other parameter meets specific conditions, the result is incorrectly displayed, returning different values when executed multiple times.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Addition and Subtraction**
    - Total sum of one of the numbers parameters must be 42 and the other parameter must be equal to 0 (zero) (e.g., 99996 and 0).
    - Run the application.
    - Observe the result.
2. **Multiplication and Division**
    - Total sum of one of the numbers parameters must be 42 and the other parameter must be equal to 1 (e.g., 888882 and 1).
    - Run the application.
    - Observe the result.

## Hints
- The issue appears to be related to the handling of the parameters that sum results in 42 for specific arithmetic operations.
- Analyzing the code under these conditions might reveal logical errors or intentional behaviors applied for specific scenarios.
- Using consistent and isolated test environments may help in reproducing the issue more reliably.
